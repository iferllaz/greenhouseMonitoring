# **Greenhouse Monitoring Analysis Using IoT Agents**

Greenhouse monitoring analysis using IoT Agents simulations, one of my firsts data analysis for experimentation and learning purposes.

The notebook provides a detailed analysis of a greenhouse environment using an Arduino agent simulator equipped with IoT sensors. The analysis is based on a simulation; all the results shown afterward are not part of any real sample. The IoT agents collect real-time data about the greenhouse's temperature, humidity, and other environmental conditions. The collected data is processed through the agent simulator, which generates a comprehensive log of the greenhouse's performance.

The report presents graphics of the analysis made with the obtained information in order to make a general visualization of the behavior of the greenhouse environment during a period of time. The report includes charts, graphs, and tables that show the trends and patterns found in the data, as well as some conclusions and recommendations based on the results. 

### Libraries

- **pandas:** Utilized for data manipulation.
- **numpy:** Provides support for arrays and mathematical functions.
- **seaborn:** Data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
- **matplotlib:** Used for creating graphs and visualizations.


### Details

The Jupyter Notebook is located in the [notebook](./notebook) file.
