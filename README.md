# Greenhouse Monitoring Analysis using IoT Agents Simulations

## Overview
This project focuses on the detailed analysis of a greenhouse environment using an Arduino agent simulator equipped with IoT sensors. The analysis is based on a simulation; all the results shown afterward are not part of any real sample. The IoT agents collect real-time data about the greenhouse's temperature, humidity, and other environmental conditions. The collected data is processed through the agent simulator, which generates a comprehensive log of the greenhouse's performance.

## Description
This repository hosts a project that explores the analysis of a greenhouse environment through IoT agent simulations. Through simulation, data on temperature, humidity, and other environmental conditions are collected and analyzed. Results are presented through charts, tables, and detailed conclusions.

## Key Features
- IoT Agent Simulation for Environmental Data Collection.
- Detailed Analysis of Temperature, Humidity, and More.
- Data Visualization Through Charts and Tables.
- Conclusions and Recommendations Based on Results.

## Purpose of Project
The primary purpose of this project is for learning and experimentation in the field of data analysis. By simulating IoT agents in a greenhouse environment, users can gain hands-on experience, experiment with data analysis techniques, and deepen their understanding of environmental behavior and trends over time.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino for Agent Simulation.
- IoT Sensors for Data Collection.
- Python for data manipulation
- Jupyter Notebook for Data Analysis and Visualization.
